# Cert Project - Tribute Page

Create a simple page containing a heading, main image and timeline of facts.

## What I learnt

Nothing new

## Reflection

So a relatively simple exercise but again my main struggle is with styling especially **_css selectors_** | **_margins_** | **_padding_**. This can only improve over time and with practice.
